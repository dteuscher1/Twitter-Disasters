This repository includes exploratory analysis and predictive modeling for the Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started).

The goal of this competition is to determine whether or not a tweet is about a real disaster. There is a lot of flexibility to the human language that machines can't always determine, so the goal is to build a machine learning model that can determine some of the nuances about whether or not a tweet is about a real disaster. The dataset provided includes id for the tweet, the text of the tweet, any keywords or location associated with the tweet. The training set also includes an additional column, `target`, that indicates whether or not the tweet is about a real disaster. There are 7613 observations in the training set, while there are 3263 observations in the test set.
